How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    Helps focus on the specific differences between files instead of manual 
    eyeballing.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Find what changes resulted in bugs.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    pro of manual commit - control over what gets saved, fewer versions to deal 
    with.
    cons - may lose some work if we forget to save the file or computer crashes.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Allow you to create a version set when you commit multiple files to batch a
    set of change and tag it as a user story/feature. google docs users typically
    just deal with one file at a time rather than a set of files as a change.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    Git log will help review the manual comments of the version history of a file.
    Git diff will help review the specifci code changes happened to a file over 
    time.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    Simply roll-back to previous version if something breaks.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
