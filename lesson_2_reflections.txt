What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
    Git creates a new repository for the current directory and creates a .git 
    file. We need this for git to know that this is the place to use to track
    files.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? 
What value do you think it offers?
    staging area is where files are kept before committing them to repository
    the value added by staging area is to stage the commit prior to committing
    to repo to avoid creating unnecessary commits or forgeting to add what you 
    changed later.
