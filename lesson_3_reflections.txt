When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    At all times. When collaborating this will help as well as serve as backup
    for your work.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    If someone else is working on the same file then you might get unwanted
    changes while you are working on that file.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Fork is available only on github to clone a remote repository into your 
    account. Cloning duplicates a repository either on remote or local.
    Branching doesn't create a new repository, it just creates a copy of the
    code-base with a new label for you to make changes. If I need to maintain
    a single code-base and develop a feature then I will use branch. When I 
    need to make changes to someone else's code-base without collaborating with
    them actively then I will use fork. When I am collaborating with someone
    else then I will use clone.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    You can know whether you are in-sync with the remote since you last synced
    or whether you have made changes since your last sync that you need to push.
    You can do this operation offline.

and what would be harder?

master?  What benefits does each approach have?
